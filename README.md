# Predicting Nonlinear Systems through Koopman-Based Autoencoder

This repository contains the code and associated files for **Major Project 2**, titled:

> **Predicting Nonlinear Systems through Koopman-Based Autoencoder**  
> *by Gaurangee Parashar and Rajashri Varadaraj*

## 📚 Overview

The project explores the prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems using Koopman-based Autoencoder models. The approach leverages deep learning—specifically TensorFlow—and includes both conventional and Transformer-based architectures for modeling system dynamics.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`report.pdf`**  
  Final project report detailing the methodology, experiments, and results.

- **`data/`**  
  Contains all datasets used for generating and training the models on various nonlinear systems.

- **`Final results/`**  
  Includes the final results referenced and discussed in the report.

- **`results/`**  
  Contains intermediate outputs and experimental results used during development and tuning.

- **`.ipynb` Code Files**  
  - Files prefixed with `transformerEncoder_` implement the **Transformer-based Koopman Autoencoder** models for various systems.
  - Other notebooks implement the **standard Koopman Autoencoder** architectures.
